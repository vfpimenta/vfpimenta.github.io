          <p>Using this page its possible to extract a lot of insightful conclusions from the input dataset. Since the data is very complex, one can explore it from different angles and come to different conclusions. The interactive tool is very flexible and, as a consequence, relies heavily on the user prior knowledge of the subject to reach the best results. This page presents a series of general insights extracted from the data for the legislature 54 to serve as examples of its potential.</p>

          <h4>The scenario</h4>

          <p>The general scenario of the chamber of deputies has some typical attributes. The majority of the congressman are from the northeast and southeast regions, the most populated, having a strong presence from the states of SP, MG RJ and BA. Regarding the type of the expenses flight ticket issue is the most prominent subquota, folloed by publicity, telecommunications and office maintenance.</p>

          <p>Looking at the time series of the data is possible to perceive a shift in the transportation type used by the congressman across the legislature. In the beginning of it there is a focus on ground and watercraft vehicles, which then changes to terrestrial and aircraft at the end of 2014. The source of this behaviour is unknown.</p>

          <h4>Polarization</h4>

          <p>Looking at specific attributes there are some cases of polarization of some aspects. Some of them are expected as the type of transportation around the country, where watercraft is more frequent on the north region where there are more rivers, also taxis and postal services are more frequently used on the southeast region with a focus on the state of SP, where is located the biggest and more populated metropolis. Another expected situation is the higher number of congressman from the left wing on the northeast and right wing on the southeast which can be felt on the elections.</p>

          <p>Some other concentrations are harder to understand and require further study like high expenses on security by the parties of the left wing, more specifically by PSD. Other parties also have dominance on certains fields like PT on the terrestrial and fluvial transportation and PR with the watercraft renting.</p>

          <h4>Profiles</h4>

          <p>Using the clustering tool it is possible to look for profiles and understand how the congressman uses their money. Setting the distance method to <b>robust</b> and the k to <b>2</b> 6 clusters can be obtained. They have a ideal general size (not too big or small) and the silhouette coefficient is the highest.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The first cluster is the largest of them, containing 125 deputies. Unlike the others, this group has peaks at the end of each year caused by a high spending on advertising. Because of this point, the total advertising expenditure in this cluster is equal to the expense with air ticket issuance, which is the highest overall expense.</li>
            <li>The second cluster has 92 deputies, but its characteristics are quite similar to the general pattern, with no property that stands out among the other clusters.</li>
            <li>The third cluster is composed of 64 deputies, concentrated in the state of Minas Gerais, surpassing the majority state of SÃ£o Paulo. These are distributed mainly in the PT and PP parties, decreasing the typically large PSDB slice. Some subquotas are also affected, with a higher proportion of watercraft rentals and office maintenance.</li>
            <li>The fourth cluster has 25 deputies, the majority of whom are from the PR party, which does not happen in the general framework. The expenses of this group also have a predominance in air ticket issuance greater than normal.</li>
            <li>The penultimate cluster has only 8 deputies, contemplating few parties and states and marked by a single peak at the end of 2014 where advertising and consulting expenses dominate.</li>
            <li>The last cluster has only 4 deputies, too small to have any detachable features.</li>
          </ul>
