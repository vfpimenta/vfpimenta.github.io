          <p>The development of the final model for this work has gone through several stages, from its inception to the present moment. During this trajectory several ways of computing the clusters were employed and so many other metrics were used to measure the quality of the resulting clusters. Broadly speaking, one can divide the development phase into many stages, each with a different focus. </p>

          <h4>Stage 1: Outlier detection</h4>
          <p>The first step of this work was focused on the task of detecting outliers within the data set, as in [3]. This idea was driven by the intuition that among spending profiles there would be expenditures that would be more distant from the others and therefore would be strong indications of undue spending and corruption. In order to perform this analysis, a Kmeans-based clustering algorithm was used, where it was expected that the overhead of each cluster behaved as a normal distribution, pointing outliers among the farthest costs of the cluster centroid. In this application each sample would be represented by the vector V (d) = [v1, v2, ..., vn] of general expenses of each Member, where each expenditure vi is the sum of all expenditures of Member d in a given month i. From the selection of a number k of clusters it would be possible to point with a degree of confidence that the deputies whose vector was outside the range [μ - t * δ2, μ + t * δ2] measured by the cluster elements would be an outlier , where the value of t defines the degree of confidence by the number of standard deviations of distance, eg t = 2.32 represents a confidence of 99%.</p>
          
          <p>This approach, although simple, has two serious problems: the first is the choice of the ideal value for the parameters k and t that can strongly influence the outliers identified by the system, the second problem is the choice of the group division quality metrics.</p>

          <p>One of the alternatives selected to solve this problem was the use of the preliminary results of deputies with suspicious expenditures of the Serenata de Amor project as benchmark of the outliers. For this validation the clusters were taken as a case of information retrieval, where the outliers obtained could be submitted to measures of precision, recall and F1. The results of this evaluation were lower than expected, with the best scenario having a F1 = 0.11 with k = 8 and t = 1.28. This result moved an investigation of the results of the Serenade of Love. What was found was that the metrics used by the serenade make up rules full of exogenous variables, such as deputies who had expenses linked to companies with false CNPJs or deputies who ate in two places at the same time. This type of data inconsistency is not captured through the established model where only the expenditure pattern is taken into account.</p>

          <p>The conclusion is that attempting to point out cases of corruption or inadequate spending becomes quite difficult without a validation strategy that relies on the available data. Faced with this situation we opted to try to identify general expenses profiles. </p>

          <h4>Stage 2: General expense profiles</h4>
          <p>The idea of ​​working with expenditure profiles directly is that it is not necessary to carry out a classification of correct and incorrect expenditures, since the work of clustering and labeling of collections must be capable of raising a set of hypotheses and conclusions that can lead to work with without being necessarily tied to this context.</p>
          
          <p>In this context we invested in a hybrid clustering model between Minimum Spanning Tree and K Nearest Neighbors [4]. Through this model it is possible to find the relations between the clusters so that a neighborhood region is formed revealing the internal behaviors. Drawing up the graphs allows observing the content of the clusters and evaluating the attributes of each deputy, such as state, party or type of expenditure, investigating the impact of each of them. The graph generated by the model varies according to the distance metric chosen to compare the time series and the number of KNN neighbors. Other factors such as the observed window of expenses, the type of expenses computed, normalization of data also influence the final result, so it is important to establish criteria for evaluation of the final graphs and to deal with problems in the database that can cause inconsistencies in the final results.</p>
